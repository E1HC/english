The perfect tenses are formed with the auxiliary verb have + a past
participle.

The perfect tenses express the idea that an action was begun in the
past and continued until a later time.

The present perfect

The present perfect tense is so named because the auxiliary have is
conjugated in the present tense. It is used to describe an action that
began in the past and continues until the present.

She has drawn her mom a picture every day for the past two weeks.

I haven’t met anyone interesting since I moved into this apartment complex.

I have navigated a sailboat many times.

He has already showered.
When combined with prepositional phrases that start with since or for, the
present perfect can also express an action or situation that began in the past and
that is still taking place in the present. Note that the concept of an action in prog-
ress or incomplete is expressed in the present perfect by a verb formed in the
progressive.
I have had these red gloves for three years.
I have liked Harold and the Purple Crayon since I was fi ve years old.
I have been living on this island for two years.
I have been standing here since eight o’clock.
